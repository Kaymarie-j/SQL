## About me 🧑🏽
Hi! I'm Kayla, an aspiring data analyst with an interest of problem solving and turning data into actionable and concise insights.
I found myself to love coding and it so happened to be SQL, although it was a bit challenging at first. With my drive and dedication to become an analyst I've started to create projects that reflect real world business scenarios. Some other tools and languages that I've learned to work with are Python, Exel, and Tableau. I love problem solving and have always been curious to see how far I could go with utilizing tools to help grow my skills in business and analytics.

## Overview 📌
In this portfolio, you will find questions I've crafted and answered to showcase my SQL skills. I've sourced datasets from Kaggle and included both spreadsheets and data visualizations through my analysis.
